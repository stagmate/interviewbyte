                    q: "Is there a tool that helps me during a live video interview?",
                    a: "Yes, InterviewMate provides real-time AI coaching during your actual interview. It listens to the interviewer's questions and instantly suggests personalized answers while you're on Zoom, Teams, or Google Meet."
                },
                {
                    q: "How fast does InterviewMate respond during an interview?",
                    a: "InterviewMate achieves <1 second latency for transcription using Deepgram Flux, with complete AI-generated answers appearing within 2-3 seconds of the interviewer finishing their question."
                },
                {
                    q: "Can I use this during a Zoom interview without the interviewer knowing?",
                    a: "InterviewMate runs in a separate browser window/tab and doesn't interfere with your video call. The AI suggestions appear on your screen only. However, users are responsible for following their company's interview policies."
                },
                {
                    q: "Does InterviewMate work on mobile phones?",
                    a: "Currently InterviewMate is optimized for desktop browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari). Mobile support is planned for future releases."

                {
                    q: "What AI technology does InterviewMate use?",
                    a: "InterviewMate uses Deepgram Flux for real-time speech-to-text (<500ms latency) and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for intelligent answer generation. This combination delivers the fastest and highest quality responses."
                },
                {
                    q: "How does InterviewMate personalize answers to my background?",
                    a: "InterviewMate uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with Qdrant vector database. You can add your resume, STAR stories, and prepared Q&A pairs. When answering questions, the AI semantically searches your background and incorporates specific details from your experience."
                },
                {
                    q: "What happens if I don't have any background information added?",
                    a: "The AI will generate answers with placeholders like [your specific project] or [company name] that you can fill in with your own details. You'll see a tip suggesting the AI Q&A Generator feature for fully personalized answers."
                },
                {
                    q: "Why is InterviewMate faster than other interview tools?",
                    a: "We eliminated threading bottlenecks by using fully async I/O architecture. Previous systems used background threads with 5-second timeouts. Our async implementation uses direct await calls, removing timeout issues entirely."

            questions: [
                {
                    q: "How does the credit system work?",
                    a: "Each interview session consumes 1 credit when you press 'Start Recording'. Credits never expire and you can use them whenever you have an interview. No subscriptions - pay only for what you use."
                },
                {
                    q: "Can I get a refund if I don't like the service?",
                    a: "All purchases are final. We offer a strict no-refund policy for digital products. However, refunds may be considered for technical issues (system failures, duplicate charges, unauthorized transactions) if reported within 7 days."
                },
                {
                    q: "What's the difference between credits and one-time features?",
                    a: "Interview credits are consumed per session (1 credit = 1 interview). One-time features like AI Q&A Generator are purchased once and available forever."
                },
                {
                    q: "Do credits expire?",
                    a: "No, credits never expire. Buy them now and use them whenever you have interviews - next week, next month, or next year."

                    a: "No. All audio is processed in real-time and immediately discarded. We use streaming transcription - audio never touches our servers or gets stored anywhere."
                },
                {
                    q: "Is my personal data safe?",
                    a: "Yes. We use strict user_id filtering in our vector database (Qdrant) to ensure complete data isolation. Your resume, STAR stories, and Q&A pairs are never shared with other users."

                {
                    q: "What data does InterviewMate collect?",
                    a: "We store: (1) Your account information (email, name), (2) Your uploaded background (resume, STAR stories, Q&A pairs), (3) Interview session metadata (timestamp, credits used). We do NOT store audio recordings or transcripts."

                    a: "InterviewMate works for any interview type: job interviews (tech, consulting, finance), PhD defenses and academic committee meetings, visa and immigration interviews, school admissions (MBA, graduate, undergraduate). Any video call where you need real-time AI assistance."

                    q: "Does InterviewMate work for visa interviews?",

                    q: "I'm a non-native English speaker - can InterviewMate help?",
                    a: "Yes! InterviewMate helps you phrase answers clearly and professionally. The AI suggests well-structured responses you can read and adapt to your speaking style."

                    q: "How is InterviewMate different from mock interview platforms?",
                    a: "Mock interviews help you practice before the interview. InterviewMate helps you DURING the actual interview when it matters most. It's real-time coaching, not practice."
                },
                {
                    q: "Why not just prepare answers beforehand?",
                    a: "You can't predict every question. Even if you prepare 50 questions, the interviewer might ask the 51st. InterviewMate handles unexpected questions in real-time."
                },
                {
                    q: "What about ChatGPT - can I just use that during interviews?",
                    a: "ChatGPT requires you to type questions manually, which takes too long during live interviews. InterviewMate automatically transcribes the interviewer's speech and generates answers instantly (<2 seconds)."
